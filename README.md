# Chainalysis Takehome - CoinPicker

# Dependencies and Setup
This project depends on Node, React and Go. For deployment, it uses Firebase (for hosting React frontend) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) (for hosting Go backend). A single firebase project is used and shared across Firebase and GCP, and will be referenced throughout most configuration as "chainalysis-takehome" (for the frontend) and "chainalysis-takehome/backend" (for the backend).   
The following steps are required to get started:

- Make sure Node and Go are installed
- Run `npm install` to install all Node modules

You can begin development and testing or just host this project locally after this step. Running `make run` will start the necessary local servers.  
The remaining steps are for setting up Cloud Build and deployment with GCP and Firebase.

- Install firebase tools with `npm install -g firebase-tools`
    - If you've just installed Firebase tools, you'll need to set that up, follow the instructions here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart
- Install `gcloud` by downloading the installers and follow the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
    - Make sure you allow the appropriate permissions in your GCP console (Cloud Run and Cloud Build).

# Building and Deployment
Both the frontend and backend of this project rely on environment variables.  

On the React side, an envrionment variable specifies where to `fetch` from, specified in `.env.development` for development, and `env.production` (which you will need to make) for production.

For Go, an envrionment variable is read that specifies the rules for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, specified in the Google Cloud Run console, under "Edit & Deploy New Revision" > "Variables & Secrets".

Build and deploy order of the frontend and backend doesn't really matter, except that one needs the address of other, so on first build, you will need to record these addresses.

- Run `make build` to build the react and go deliverables
- Run `make deploy-frontend` to deploy to Firebase hosting
    - You will get the address of your now deployed React app; this will be the `FRONTEND` variable you set in the Cloud Run console later 
- Run `make deploy-backend` to deploy to Cloud Run. This is like running `make deploy-frontend`; you will now get the url of your backend Copy this into a new file `.env.production`, which should look like `.env.development`
- Now go into the Cloud Run console and and set the `FRONTEND` variable
- Lastly, run `make build-frontend` and `make deploy-frontend`
